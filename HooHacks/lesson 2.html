                    <h2>Brainstorming Session:</h2>
                    <p>Once you have identified a common topic of interest within your team, your going to want to have a brainstorming session. In this session, you will write down any idea that comes to mind and encourage your group members to do the same. (Remember there are NO bad ideas, any idea could be good at this stage and you don't want to rule out anything)</p>

                <div class="l2-item">
                    <h2>Eliminate:</h2>
                    <p>Once you feel that you have every possible idea written down, it's time to start eliminating. This means identifying pros and cons and         analyzing which ideas have the most potential to make a difference in addition to which ideas you think are creative. In this stage you are trying to eliminate anything that is not creative, not solving a problem, or not achievable.</p>

                    <h2>Ask a Mentor:</h2>
                    <p>The final step in your idea stage is getting another opinion. In hackathons you will almost always have access to mentors so try to use them to your advantage by asking them for an opinion regarding your idea as they will have different experiences that allow them to see it from another angle.</p>
