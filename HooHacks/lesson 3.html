                    <h2>Identify the project's priorities and targets:</h2>
                    <p>In this step, you will need to identify what your goals are for this project and what you want to achieve in the given time frame. You can then have these written down so that everybody in the group knows what the goals are and can contribute accordingly.</p>

                <div class="l2-item">
                    <h2>Assign tasks to group members:</h2>
                    <p>Now that you have identified priorities and targets you can move on to work distribution. This step is crucial in ensuring the efficiency of the work being done in your group. Once you have established the different portions of your project, assign tasks to different group members to work on according to skills, workload as well as interests.(ie. research, code, etc.) This will ensure that everyone is working on something that they can contribute to and will ultimately allow your team to avoid wasting time.</p>

                    <h2>Maintain communication:</h2>
                    <p>While everybody is working on their assigned tasks make sure that you regroup every once in a while to provide updates as far as progress and any changes being made in order to ensure that everybody stays informed.</p>

                <div class="l2-item">
                    <h2>Ask a Mentor:</h2>
                    <p>At this stage, once you are pretty much done your project you are going to want to run it by a mentor again in order to gain some perspective and get advice on possible changes or additions that make sure your project is in good shape.</p>

                <div class="l2-item">
                    <h2>Review and Practice</h2>
                    <p>You're almost there! You've done the hard work now it's time to review your work and submit your project or practice for your presentation if there is one. Good Luck and we wish you all the best! Happy Hacking!</p>
